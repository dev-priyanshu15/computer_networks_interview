# 🌸 Part 1: Networking Basics to OSI Model (Simplified for Interview)

## 🔹 What is a Network?

A **network** is a group of connected computers that share resources and communicate with each other.

When many networks connect together, it becomes the **Internet** — a network of networks.

---

## 🔹 How Did the Internet Start?

- The Internet started as a U.S. government project called **ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)**.
- It connected universities like **MIT, Stanford, UCLA, and Utah**.
- Communication happened using **TCP/IP protocol**, which became the foundation of the Internet.

---

## 🔹 What is a Protocol?

A **protocol** is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted between devices.

**Examples:**
- **TCP** – Ensures reliable data delivery
- **IP** – Handles addressing and routing
- **UDP** – Sends data fast, without guarantee of delivery

---

## 🔹 World Wide Web (WWW)

- The **WWW** is a system of interlinked documents accessed through the Internet.
- Each web page has a **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** for identification.
- It uses **hyperlinks** to connect pages.
- **Internet Society** develops and maintains these protocols.

---

## 🔹 Client-Server Architecture

- **Client** → Sends a request (e.g. browser requesting google.com)
- **Server** → Processes request and sends a response (e.g. Google server returning results)

**Example:**

```
Client = google.com
Server = Google Server
```

👉 **Request → Response**

---

## 🔹 Basic Protocols

### **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- Ensures reliable and error-free delivery of data.
- If any packet is lost, it is re-sent.

### **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- Used when speed is more important than reliability.
- **Example:** Video calls, live streaming, gaming.

### **HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)**
- Used by web browsers to fetch web pages from servers.
- Transfers data between client and server.

---

# 🔹 IP Address

- Every device on the Internet has a unique **IP address**.
- **Format:** `x.x.x.x` (each X ranges from 0–255).
  - **Example:** `192.168.1.1`

**To check your IP:**

```bash
curl ifconfig.me -s
```

---

## 🔹 Local vs Global IP

- **Local IP:** Used inside your home network (e.g., laptop to router).
- **Global IP:** Used to identify your network on the Internet.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** automatically assigns local IPs.

---

## 🔹 NAT (Network Address Translation)

- Router translates local IPs into global IPs when sending data to the Internet.

---

## 🔹 Ports

- Ports identify applications on a device.
- Port numbers are **16-bit values**.

**Examples:**
- **HTTP → 80**
- **MongoDB → 27017**

**Ranges:**
- **0–1023** → Reserved
- **1024–49152** → Registered for apps
- **Remaining** → Private use

---

## 🔹 Speed Units

- **1 Kbps** = 1,000 bits/sec
- **1 Mbps** = 1,000,000 bits/sec
- **1 Gbps** = 1,000,000,000 bits/sec

---

## 🔹 Types of Networks

| Type | Coverage | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **LAN (Local Area Network)** | Small area | Home, School |
| **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** | City | Multiple offices |
| **WAN (Wide Area Network)** | Large area | Internet |

👉 **Multiple LANs + MANs = Internet**

---

## 🔹 Important Networking Devices

- **Modem:** Converts digital ↔ analog signals.
- **Router:** Forwards data between networks.
- **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** Provides Internet access (Airtel, Jio, TATA).
- **SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking):** Fiber-based communication.
- **Frame Relay:** Connects LANs to WANs.

---

# 🔹 Network Topologies

1. **Bus Topology** – One main cable; if it breaks, the whole network fails.
2. **Ring Topology** – Devices connected in a ring; one break stops communication.
3. **Star Topology** – All devices connected to a central hub; if hub fails, all fail.
4. **Tree Topology** – Combination of bus + star; hierarchical structure.
5. **Mesh Topology** – Every device connected to every other; reliable but costly.

---

# 🔹 TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP (Internet Protocol Suite) has **5 layers:**

1. **Application Layer** – Apps like browsers, chat apps.
2. **Transport Layer** – Segments data, ensures reliable delivery.
3. **Network Layer** – Handles routing and addressing.
4. **Data Link Layer** – Deals with MAC addresses.
5. **Physical Layer** – Handles cables, signals, and transmission.

---

# 🔹 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

OSI model has **7 layers** (more detailed than TCP/IP):

1. **Application** – End-user apps (browser, chat).
2. **Presentation** – Data conversion, encryption, compression.
3. **Session** – Manages connections and authentication.
4. **Transport** – Segments, sequencing, and flow control.
5. **Network** – Logical addressing (IP).
6. **Data Link** – Physical addressing (MAC).
7. **Physical** – Hardware transmission (cables, wires).

---

## ✅ Quick Interview Recap

- Internet started with **ARPANET**.
- **Protocol** = Rules for communication.
- **IP** identifies a device; **Port** identifies an app.
- **TCP** = Reliable, **UDP** = Fast.
- **Topologies** = Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh, Tree.
- **OSI** = 7 layers; **TCP/IP** = 5 layers.
- **LAN** → Local, **MAN** → City, **WAN** → Global.

---

# ⚙️ Part 2: Application Layer, Email, DNS & Transport Layer (Simplified English for Interview)

## 🌸 Application Layer

- This is the **topmost layer** — where the **user interacts directly with the network**.
- It includes applications like **web browsers, chat apps, Gmail, etc.**
- Lies on the **client's system** (your device).

### 🔹 Client-Server Architecture

- **Client** → Sends a request
- **Server** → Responds with data

**Example:**

You open Google → browser (client) sends request → Google server replies with web page.

- **Server** = System hosting the website.
- **Data Center** = A collection of many servers.
- Data centers have **static IPs, high upload speed, and fast Internet**.

---

## 📦 Ping Command

**Command:**

```bash
ping google.com
```

- Used to measure **round-trip time** between your computer and the destination.
- Helps check **network connectivity**.

---

## 🤝 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

- **No dedicated server.**
- Every computer acts as **both client and server**.
- Easy to scale and good for small setups.
- **Example:** Torrent sharing, LAN games.

---

## 🌐 Web Protocols

### 🔹 HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

- Used for **communication between client and server**.
- When a client sends a request → it's an **HTTP Request**.
- When the server responds → it's an **HTTP Response**.
- Works over **TCP**.
- It is **stateless**, meaning the server doesn't remember previous requests by default.

---

## ⚡ HTTP Methods

| Method | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **GET** | Request data from the server |
| **POST** | Send new data to server |
| **PUT** | Update existing data |
| **DELETE** | Remove data |

---

## ⚠️ HTTP Status Codes

These tell whether a request was successful or not.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **200** | Success |
| **400** | Bad Request |
| **404** | Not Found |
| **500** | Internal Server Error |

**Categories:**

- **1xx** → Information
- **2xx** → Success
- **3xx** → Redirection
- **4xx** → Client Error
- **5xx** → Server Error

---

## 🍪 Cookies

- Small data stored in your browser to identify you when you revisit a website.
- **Example:** When you log in, a cookie helps the site remember you next time.
- **Third-party cookies** are made by sites you don't directly visit (like ads or trackers).

---

## 📧 How Email Works

### 🔹 Email Protocols

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** – Sends emails.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol)** – Downloads emails (one device only).
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** – Syncs emails on multiple devices.
- **TCP** is the transport protocol used underneath.

**Example command:**

```bash
nslookup -type=mx gmail.com
```

(to check mail exchange records)

---

## 🌍 DNS (Domain Name System)

- DNS converts **domain names → IP addresses**.
- It's like a **phonebook** of the Internet.
- When you type "google.com", the browser uses DNS to find its IP.
- DNS stores data in a **directory/database**.

**Example:**

```
mail.google.com →
```

- **"mail"** = subdomain
- **"google"** = second-level domain
- **".com"** = top-level domain

---

## 🌐 Root DNS Server

- Responsible for managing top-level domains (.com, .org, .edu, .in, etc.).
- Controlled by **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**.

**Example Flow:**

1. Computer checks **local DNS cache**.
2. If not found → asks **ISP's DNS**.
3. ISP asks **Root DNS** → **TLD Server** → **Authoritative Server**.
4. Gets IP → returns to user.

**Command:**

```bash
dig google.com
```

---

## ⚡ Transport Layer Basics

- Moves data from one computer to another.
- Acts as a **bridge** between **Application** and **Network Layer**.
- Provides **end-to-end communication** and **error control**.
- Located on **both devices** (sender and receiver).

---

## 📦 Data Unit Names

| Layer | Data Unit |
|-------|-----------|
| **Transport** | Segments |
| **Network** | Packets |
| **Data Link** | Frames |

---

## 🌿 How Data Travels

- Data is broken into **packets** at the sender's end.
- Each packet gets a **socket port number** for tracking.
- **TCP** ensures all packets arrive correctly and in order.

---

## ✅ Checksum

- Used for **error detection**.
- Sender calculates checksum and sends it with the packet.
- Receiver calculates its own checksum:
  - **If both match** → data is correct.
  - **If not** → error found.

---

## ⏱️ Timer Concept

- Each sent packet starts a **timer**.
- If **acknowledgment doesn't arrive in time** → packet is resent.

---

## 🔵 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- **Connectionless** → doesn't establish connection before sending data.
- **Faster** but **less reliable** than TCP.
- Used in **real-time apps:** video calls, DNS, gaming.
- Uses **checksum** but ignores small errors.

### **UDP Packet Structure:**

| Field | Size |
|-------|------|
| **Source Port** | 2 bytes |
| **Destination Port** | 2 bytes |
| **Length** | 2 bytes |
| **Checksum** | 2 bytes |

**Total Header Size: 8 bytes.**

---

## ✅ Quick Interview Recap

- **Application Layer** = Where users interact.
- **HTTP** = Stateless, client-server communication.
- **Email** = SMTP (send), POP3 (receive), IMAP (sync).
- **DNS** = Domain → IP.
- **Root DNS** = Managed by ICANN.
- **Transport Layer** = End-to-end communication.
- **UDP** = Fast, **TCP** = Reliable.
- **Ping** = Measures latency.

---

# ⚙️ Part 3 (Pages 11–17): IP Addressing, Subnetting, Firewall, DHCP, ARP – Interview Simplified Edition

## 🌐 Network Layer

- Network Layer handles **routing** — moving data from one network to another using **routers**.
- Each router has its own **network address**.
- Routers decide the next path (**hop-by-hop**) using a **routing table**.

**Example:**

```
192.168.2.30
```

- **Network part** → `192.168.2`
- **Host (device) part** → `.30`

---

## ⚙️ Routing Types

### 1. **Static Routing:**
- Manual configuration by network admin.
- Does not adapt to network changes.

### 2. **Dynamic Routing:**
- Updates automatically when network changes.
- More flexible and reliable.

---

## 🌍 IP Versions

| Version | Bits | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **IPv4** | 32-bit (4 words) | Most common, limited addresses (~4.3 billion) |
| **IPv6** | 128-bit | Next-gen, larger space, uses hexadecimal |

---

## 🔹 ISPs (Internet Service Providers) get **blocks of IPs**, which they assign to users. This is called **subnetting**.

---

## 🔢 Classes of IPv4 Addresses

| Class | Range | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **A** | 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 | Large networks |
| **B** | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 | Medium networks |
| **C** | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 | Small networks |
| **D** | 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 | Multicasting |
| **E** | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 | Experimental |

---

## 📐 Subnet Masking

- Subnet mask divides an IP address into **network part** and **host part**.
- **Example:** `255.255.255.0` → means first 24 bits are network, remaining for host.
- You can choose your own subnet length (**variable length subnetting**).

**Example:**

```
15.0.0.0/30 → first 30 bits are for network, remaining for host.
```

---

## 🚫 Reserved Addresses

- **127.0.0.1** → Loopback address (used to test your own device).
- **Example:** "localhost" also refers to this address.

---

## ⏳ TTL (Time To Live)

- TTL defines **how long a packet can stay active** on the network.
- If it doesn't reach the destination within that time, it's **discarded**.

---

## 🆚 IPv4 vs IPv6

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|---------|------|------|
| **Address Space** | 2³² (~4.3B) | 2¹²⁸ (huge) |
| **Format** | Decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1) | Hexadecimal |
| **Compatibility** | Backward | Not backward compatible |
| **Transition** | Easy | Needs new hardware |

IPv6 was introduced because **IPv4 addresses were running out**.

---

## 📦 Middleboxes

Devices that sit **between networks** and help manage traffic.

**Examples:**

1. **Firewall**
2. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

They mainly work in the **Network Layer**, but sometimes at **Transport Layer** too.

---

## 🔥 Firewall

A **firewall** filters packets based on rules (like address, port, protocol, etc.).

### 🔹 Types of Firewall

#### 1. **Stateless Firewall**
- Doesn't remember past data (treats each packet individually).
- Less secure, less efficient.

#### 2. **Stateful Firewall**
- Remembers active connections (tracks session state).
- More secure and efficient.

---

## 🌐 NAT (Network Address Translation)

- Converts **private IPs → public IPs** when sending data to the Internet.
- Allows multiple devices in a local network to share **one public IP**.

**Example:**

Your phone, laptop, and TV all use one Internet connection through the router.

---

## 🔗 Data Link Layer

- Sends packets from **Network Layer** over a **physical medium** (like cable or Wi-Fi).
- Works with **MAC addresses** (unique IDs for devices).

---

## 💡 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- **Automatically assigns IP addresses** to new devices.
- Router or DHCP Server maintains a **pool of IPs** and gives one to each connected device.

**Flow:**

```arduino
New Device → DHCP Server → Assigns available IP → Device joins network
```

---

## 🔵 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

- Converts an **IP address ↔ MAC address**.
- If the MAC address is not in memory, ARP **broadcasts a message** to find it.

**Example:**

Device A wants to talk to Device B → checks **ARP cache** → if not found, asks all → once B responds, A stores its MAC for next time.

---

## 🖼️ Frame in Data Link Layer

A **frame** is the smallest data unit at this layer. It contains:

- **Sender's MAC address**
- **Receiver's MAC address**
- **Data + IP info**

---

## ✅ Quick Interview Recap

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Router** | Forwards packets based on IP |
| **IPv4** | 32-bit, old version |
| **IPv6** | 128-bit, larger and faster |
| **Subnet Mask** | Separates network & host parts |
| **TTL** | Time limit for packet travel |
| **NAT** | Converts local IPs to global |
| **Firewall** | Filters network traffic |
| **DHCP** | Assigns IPs automatically |
| **ARP** | Finds MAC address of devices |
| **Data Link** | Sends frames over cables/Wi-Fi |

---

## 🌟 Bonus Interview Lines:

- *"NAT hides internal IPs from the Internet — it adds a security layer."*
- *"DHCP makes networking plug-and-play; no manual IP setup needed."*
- *"ARP is essential for LAN communication since devices talk via MAC, not IP."*
- *"IPv6 removes address shortage and supports better routing efficiency."*
